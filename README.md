# Capstone Project


Jupyter notebook: [Capstone_project-PanktiModi.ipynb](https://github.com/panmodi/capstone_project/blob/main/Capstone_project-PanktiModi.ipynb)

Data used: [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=43438&sort=runs)

### Load and clean up data

* Uploaded the data from [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=43438&sort=runs) with fetch_openml
* Stored them locally as books_dataset.csv
* Checked the missing data and dropped unwanted columns which are not needed for now
#### Clean up data details
* Checked if 'author' can be filled with 'author_link'. Link is not working most of the times. The number is farely low(6) so dropped them
* Checked 'title' as some values are already space, filling NaN with space. Quite a lot of 'title' has more than 1 space as values. Processed that and made all of those as single space
* Processed 'author' also same way by making more than 1 space as single space
* Created books['is_series'] column from books['series'] 
* Created books['no_of_other_books_in_series'] from processing books['books_in_series'] 
* books['award_count'] from books['awards']
* books['year_published'] from processing books['date_published']
* books['is_high_rated'] from books['average_rating'] which can be used as 'y' to predict
* books['primary_genre'] from processing and using first genre from books['genre_and_votes'] and ignoring votes number
* books['publisher'] filled NaN with 'Other'

### Visualizations of data
Added code for visualisation of the data with various charts
* Average Ratings
* Top 15 Authors with the Most Books. Data is cleaned by ignoring space and comma as author. 'NOT A BOOK' is usually some articles in goodreads
* Top 10 authors star distibution. We can see 'J K Rowling' is here twice for 'Harry Potter' series for diffent editions with it's atrist.
* Popular books vs niche books. Book can be considered popular if rating_count > 10k
* Top 10 frequent Publishers. Ignoring other as it comes as top publisher as in clean up we replaced all spaces and NaN with 'Other'
* Distribution of Books by Rating and Awards Won
* Rating Trend Over Time (Since 1980). Used the column which we added 'year_published'

### Baseline Model
Used few of the columns which has books metadata like 'author','publisher','primary_genre','is_series','no_of_other_books_in_series','year_published' as X and 'is_high_rated' will be used as y

```
Accuracy: 0.7083918763571337
[[5033 2270]
 [2296 6059]]
```

* This model's accuracy is around 70.8%. 
* I tried all the commented columns dataset from previous cell of code with same model above and always getting results ~70%. Meaning with provided columns the model has converged and now stable. We need to use some other columns and models to come up with better results.
* The current model can be used by marketing/sales team to predict and target which books to market more on and can have higher sales

### Future work

#### Clean up data
* Make all space ‘title’, ‘author’ as ‘Other’
* Clean up Genre more by combining some e.g. make Romance-Romantic Suspense, Romance-M M Romance as Romance
